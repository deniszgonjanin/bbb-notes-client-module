A BigBlueButton module for the Live Notes server: https://github.com/ielashi/live-notes-server

The module currently resides in the main bbb repo at https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton. The most up to date code for the module can be found there.

To enable the module, uncomment it in the client's config.xml file.
In BigBlueButton.html, you need to uncomment the two javascript helper files that belong to the NotesModule. Alternatively, uncomment these same files in index.template.html and rebuild the client.
